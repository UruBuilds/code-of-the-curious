# Reflection — 01: Variables & Values

> “To name a thing is to give it breath in memory.”

In this lesson, we explored variables — not just as programming constructs, but as acts of intentional memory. Each `let` and `const` was a small declaration of what matters, what is allowed to shift, and what must remain still.

- `let` reflected our capacity to change.
- `const` guarded what is sacred.
- Each variable name was chosen with care — not for machines, but for minds that build.

As you code, ask yourself:

- What am I asking this machine to remember?
- What parts of my work — my self — must never be altered?
- What do I name, not because I have to, but because I _believe_ in it?

This isn’t just about JavaScript. This is about shaping thought, shaping presence.

## 🌿 Prompt

> Create three variables that reflect your current moment — one that may change (`let`), one that must not (`const`), and one that reminds you to stay curious.

Name them with the fullness of your soul.

Then read them aloud.

This is how we begin.
